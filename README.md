Hi, this is my first attempt at creating a Todo List App and I'm really
surprised but not still satisfied at the outcome,

I developed this app using Html, Css and Javascript.
I plan on developing the React version which I believe should be a lot more 
straight forward, easier than this version.

Please let me know what you think!
